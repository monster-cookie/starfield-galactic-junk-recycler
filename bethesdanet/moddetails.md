# Overview
Venworks Junk Recycler will break down your old armor, weapons, clothing, books, and junk from your exploration and give you usable resources at any workbench in the game.

We want this to be an option for players that do not like the outpost mining mess and need a way to get the resources you can't from pure exploration.

# Usage

## Recycling Items
Aim at the workbench you should see a new option recycle

1. Press the bound key (see below) for recycle.
2. Transfer/Deposit the items you want to recycle into it.
3. The broken-down materials are immediately transferred to your inventory.

### Keybinds (PC)
- Default is R but sometimes shifts to space

### Keybinds (Console/PC Gamepad)
- Default is X but sometimes Y to space

## Modifying the rules
New instructions are coming due to not being able to use RTFP with consoles. Currently the keywords are mapped in an init quest with a fallback of random return. 

# Compatibility
Below are Creations we have known compatibility problems with and workarounds if we have them.

- Workbench Filter Framework (WFF), please load Junk Recycler after WFF in the load order
